## Special thanks to

### BorderDestroyer, ARussianSpy, Ott3r_, My Cybersecurity Teacher, My Computer Science Teacher
With each one of your help I have been able to make these files exist and come to life! While I may not express my grattitude in the moment, trust me, I am very grateful for each one of yall's work in helping and supporting me. Thank you to BorderDestroyer, and Ott3r_ for tesinging my software in its complete state. Thank you to ARussianSpy for testing my software in its rough state.

## What is ErroxCollection

ErroxCollection is, well, a collection of every Errox file I have made. Some that dont even have their own repo will be held here soon enough.

## Errox:

The script that started it all, Errox.java is a simple java script that will simply open 100 popups that say "ERROX!" with the ERROX title

## Errox_2:

Errox_2.py was my second time dipping into python programing, it took me a whole month to create. It works by going through the files in its current directory and then hashing them with SHA512

## Errox_7:

Errox_7 was my first post here on GitHub, it is remote access software for Unix systems that have nc installed, only works if both users are on the same network

## Errox_8:

Errox_8 was truly one of my best scripts, it not only finds open ports (besided ones the user is blocked on), and is just a basic port scanner for Unix systems, can only scan IPv4 addresses

## Errox_9:

Errox_9 was my first time trying out things like arp packets, and I think it went well and works as a network scanner for Unix systems, can only detect devices on same network.

## Errox_Collector:

Errox_Collector is one of my newest works, I have used it in some real applications when I was in my cybersecurity class, it is a python file that searches for metadata and other information in scripts
