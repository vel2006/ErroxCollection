# ErroxCollection

## Special thanks to

With each one of your help I have been able to make these files exist and come to life! While I may not express my grattitude in the moment, trust me, I am very grateful for each one of yall's work in helping and supporting me. Thank you to BorderDestroyer, and Ott3r_ for tesinging my software in its complete state. Thank you to ARussianSpy for testing my software in its rough state.

## What is ErroxCollection

ErroxCollection is, well, a collection of every Errox file I have made. Some that dont even have their own repo will be held here soon enough.

## Errox:

The script that started it all, Errox.java is a simple java script that will simply open 100 popups that say "ERROX!" with the ERROX title

## Errox_2:

Errox_2.py was my second time dipping into python programing, it took me a whole month to create. It works by going through the files in its current directory and then hashing them with SHA512

## Errox_3:

Errox_3.sh was my first time trying out Bash scripting. It has the same idea as Errox_2, but without the spreading throught the file system. I dont quite know why I made it.

## Errox_7:

Errox_7 was my first post here on GitHub, it is remote access software for Unix systems that have nc installed, only works if both users are on the same network

## Errox_8:

Errox_8 was truly one of my best scripts, it not only finds open ports (besided ones the user is blocked on), and is just a basic port scanner for Unix systems, can only scan IPv4 addresses

## Errox_9:

Errox_9 was my first time trying out things like arp packets, and I think it went well and works as a network scanner for Unix systems, can only detect devices on same network.

## Errox_Collector:

Errox_Collector is a python file that searches for metadata and other information in scripts, images, .pyc files and more to come!

## ErroxWeb:

ErroxWeb is a webscraper, it works by checking the response code of a page, if its 200 or 403 it gets added.

## ErroxVoice:

ErroxVoice is a basic TTS program, all it does is convert the input text into TTS and saves it into a file. It is really more of an automation script that anything else, this was an older file I dug out of my archives and through it needed some love. After some basic fixings in terms of logic and user input, I put it here.
